      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research sits at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and computation. I use molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling methods, and machine learning to understand how biomolecules move, interact, and function. By bridging computational modeling with experimental techniques like cryo-EM and NMR spectroscopy, I aim to uncover the physical principles governing protein dynamics and molecular recognition.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/postlab/" target="_blank" class="link link-primary">Post Lab</a> at Purdue University, where I investigate enhanced sampling of biomolecules, regulation of kinases, and AI-driven approaches to predict protein structural dynamics.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Research Impact</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      My work has contributed to advancing computational methods for understanding biomolecular systems, from elucidating inhibitor binding mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 drug targets to uncovering the conformational dynamics of glycoproteins and adhesins. With 40+ publications and 480+ citations, this research has applications spanning drug discovery, antiviral therapeutics, and fundamental structural biology.
